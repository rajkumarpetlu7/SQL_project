# Tools Used

he following tools and technologies were employed to conduct the analysis and manage the project:

SQL: Used for querying and analyzing the dataset. SQL scripts enabled us to extract, transform, and analyze data from the database efficiently.
PostgreSQL: The relational database management system utilized to store and manage the data. PostgreSQL's robust feature set was crucial for handling complex queries and ensuring data integrity.
CSV Files: Some of the data was stored in CSV files, which were imported into the PostgreSQL database for comprehensive analysis.
GitHub: Utilized for version control and collaboration. All SQL scripts and related documentation were maintained in a GitHub repository, facilitating seamless teamwork and tracking changes over time.
Visual Studio Code (VSCode): The primary code editor used for writing and editing SQL scripts. With its rich extension ecosystem, VSCode provided enhanced functionality, such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and integration with version control systems.
